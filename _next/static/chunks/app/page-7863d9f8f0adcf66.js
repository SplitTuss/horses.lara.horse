Knabstruppers are known for the tricks they like participating in, so he knew almost all of them (besides rearing and kicking, which is smart not to teach a tall school horse who gets ridden by 5-year-olds, some of them disabled). All that being said, he did kick me in the knee and sent me flying 4 meters through the air. But that wasn't his intention; there was a bee on his belly and it wouldn't go away and I walked around him right behind him, which you're not supposed to do for a reason. (I still do it with horses I know but I never take my hand off of their butt while I walk around them, so they don't forget that I'm there. Lesson taught!) When Jasko saw what he did, you could tell that he felt bad and he wanted to come check on me. He couldn't because he was tied to a pole, since we were brushing them to go for a ride, but he WOULD have if he could have.

I was able to ride Tralee without a saddle and without a bridle and he would still be perfect. I could ride such small lope circles that it was almost a piaffe, with no bridle and no saddle, of course. I jumped small obstacles with him even though he was never trained for jumping. I went on many trail rides with him, even some in the dark where I was pretty sure I was lost but he never was, he found home. I could go on trail rides (obviously) without saddle or bridle.
