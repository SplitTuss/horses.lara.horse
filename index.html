A few years later they did the same thing and I also did that one with him because he was such a reliable and fun horse.

He taught me a lot of things, including how to jump onto a tall horses&#x27; back without a saddle or tree stump. Knabstruppers are known for the tricks they like participating in, so he knew almost all of them (besides rearing and kicking, which is smart not to teach a tall school horse who gets ridden by 5-year-olds, some of them disabled). All that being said, he did kick me in the knee and sent me flying 4 meters through the air. But that wasn&#x27;t his intention; there was a bee on his belly and it wouldn&#x27;t go away and I walked around him right behind him, which you&#x27;re not supposed to do for a reason. (I still do it with horses I know but I never take my hand off of their butt while I walk around them, so they don&#x27;t forget that I&#x27;m there. Lesson taught!) When Jasko saw what he did, you could tell that he felt bad and he wanted to come check on me. He couldn&#x27;t because he was tied to a pole, since we were brushing them to go for a ride, but he WOULD have if he could have. He was a wonderful companion and I am grateful to have bonded with him the way that I did.

So I did. I had the honor of working with Tralee for two years before he too was sold, for reasons that to this day upset me. He wasn&#x27;t my horse though so there&#x27;s nothing I could do. I was able to ride Tralee without a saddle and without a bridle and he would still be perfect. I could ride such small lope circles that it was almost a piaffe, with no bridle and no saddle, of course. I jumped small obstacles with him even though he was never trained for jumping. I went on many trail rides with him, even some in the dark where I was pretty sure I was lost but he never was, he found home. I could go on trail rides (obviously) without saddle or bridle. I got to show him once, in a Western pleasure. It is impossible to write more about him at this time because my heart is breaking all over again.</p></div><div class="grid grid-cols-4 items-center justify-center"><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.horses.lara.horse/tralee/tralee1.JPG" alt="Tralee and me" width="180" class="mx-auto cursor-pointer hover:opacity-80 p-1"/><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.horses.lara.horse/tralee/tralee2.jpg" alt="Tralee and me without saddle in a field" width="180" class="mx-auto cursor-pointer hover:opacity-80 p-1"/><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.horses.lara.horse/tralee/tralee3.JPG" alt="Tralee&#x27;s face" width="180" class="mx-auto cursor-pointer hover:opacity-80 p-1"/><img src="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.horses.lara.horse/tralee/tralee4.JPG" alt="Tralee and me at a Western Pleasure show" width="180" class="mx-auto cursor-pointer hover:opacity-80 p-1"/></div></div></section><section class="mt-1"><div class="flex flex-col items-center border-2 border-dotted border-purple-700 rounded-xl p-4 sm:m-0 mx-2"><p class="font-bold text-2xl text-purple-500">Pico, aka Pixel</p><p>14 years old<!-- -->, <!-- -->Quarter Horse-Wels Pony mix, gelding</p><button class="text-purple-200 underline hover:cursor-pointer hover:text-purple-400">read more about this horse</button><div class="
